# Vibe Coding Challenge – CO₂ Browser Game 🌱

Interactive 3D browser game that playfully demonstrates how many trees a person would need to plant to offset their own CO₂ footprint. 

This repository is part of a **Vibe Coding Challenge** by [Deckeins](https://www.deckeins.de) & [CaptainAI](https://www.captain-ai.de) – open to AI trainers, educators, developers and anyone interested in combining environmental education with creativity and artificial intelligence.

## The Challenge

The **Vibe Coding Challenge** invites you to develop your own AI-supported browser game that creatively explores how large our CO₂ footprint is – and how we can reduce or even neutralize it.

**What is Vibe Coding?**  
“Vibe Coding” is a creative approach to software development where you use the power of AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to brainstorm, prototype, and build digital ideas – quickly, intuitively, and with a good dose of fun.

**The Challenge:**
Design and develop a browser game that playfully shows how many trees a person in Germany would need to plant to offset their annual CO₂ emissions – or create another original approach that makes CO₂ impact and compensation tangible and interactive.

**There are no limits to creativity:**
Whether it's a tree-planting simulator, flight-mile clicker, clothing impact calculator or CO₂ quiz – everything is welcome that makes **knowledge experiential**.

## Sample Solutions

As inspiration, this repository includes a sample solution built with Three.js and generative AI.  
In this game, players click to plant trees and reduce a CO₂ meter from 12,000 kg to 0.  
The 3D world visually changes as progress is made – providing an **engaging and educational experience**.
