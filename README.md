# Vibe Coding Chellange – CO₂ Browser Game 🌱

An interactive 3D browser game that playfully demonstrates how many trees a person would need to plant to offset their own CO₂ footprint.

This repository is part of a **Vibe Coding Challenge** by [Deckeins](https://www.deckeins.de) & [CaptainAI](https://www.captain-ai.de) – open to AI trainers, educators, developers and anyone interested in combining environmental education with creativity and artificial intelligence.

## Purpose of the Vibe Coding Challenge

The **VIBE Coding Challenge** invites you to develop your own AI-supported browser game that creatively explores how large our CO₂ footprint is – and how we can reduce or even neutralize it.


## The Challenge

Design and develop a browser game that playfully shows how many trees a person in Germany would need to plant to offset their annual CO₂ emissions – or create another original approach that makes CO₂ impact and compensation tangible and interactive.

**There are no limits to creativity:**  
Whether it's a tree-planting simulator, flight-mile clicker, clothing impact calculator or CO₂ quiz – everything is welcome that makes **knowledge experiential**.


## Sample Solution

As inspiration, this repository includes a sample solution built with Three.js and generative AI.  
In this game, players click to plant trees and reduce a CO₂ meter from 12,000 kg to 0.  
The 3D world visually changes as progress is made – providing an **engaging and educational experience**.
